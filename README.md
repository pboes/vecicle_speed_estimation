# Vehicle Speed Detection

## Usage

Currently, once you have all the requirements installed, execute the monodepth2/speed_check.py

To change the video, change the path on line 14 of speed_check.py

To move away from the depth estimation approach to the eucliddean distance one of the original poster, set the "use_depth_estimation" flag on line 25 to False. 

Something funny happened with the nested repositories. The monodepth2 is shown as a gitlink and submodule (even though I deleted the .git folder). I hope this doesn't create any problems
